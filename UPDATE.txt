So, I've dropped this project due to me being unable to get the output from the terminal and put it into tkinter. The GMNM has been a nice little project for me,
it was pretty fun to make, but now it's getting tedious. Maybe I'll revisit this project in the future and finally complete it!
If someone is curious and wants to check out where I left this project off here:


#GUESS MY NAME MACHINE 1.0 (NOT FINISHED AND IN A BAD STATE)
import tkinter as tk
from PIL import ImageTk, Image
import random

window = tk.Tk() # instantiate an instance of a window
window.geometry("1080x800")
window.title("Guess My Name Machine 1.0")
im = Image.open("machine.ico")
ph = ImageTk.PhotoImage(im)
window.iconphoto(True, ph)
#entry = tk.Entry(window,
#              font=("Arial", 30))
#entry.pack(side=tk.LEFT)

window.mainloop() #place window on computer screen
            
# I also want to inpliment a better names list. And lastly I'd make it have a UI with ktinker
# where it reveals the letters you write like hangmanchen and impliment tips aswell

#Limited tries CHECK
#Tries left CHECK
#Name and Win CHECK
#List for guesses CHECK
#Only one letter CHECK
#Get out of Programm with 0 CHECK
#Try another name (POSTPONED cause of tk)







Summary: This project will not recive anymore updates for a long time.
See Ya!
